Description:

This tutorial will cover how to apply a crossfade transition between different scenes when the left mouse button is pressed.

Assets:

Scenes 2x
Two different objects to see the transition taking place.


Preparation in Unity:

Create an empty game object and name it "Level Loader".

Inside "Level Loader" create a UI Canvas.

Rename it to "Crossfade".

Under "Canvas Scale" go to "UI Scale Mode" and change it from "Constant Pixel Size" to "Scale With Screen Size".

Inside "Crossfade" create a UI Image.

Change its colour to black.

To fit the black box to the screen click on the stretch box in the inspector, hold down alt and press the box in the bottom right corner.

Add the component "Canvas Group" to Image and uncheck "Interactables" and "Blocks Raycasts".


Now go to Animations.

Create a new animation and name it "Crossfase_End".

Go to one second on the animation timeline and turn down the alpha in "Canvas Group" to zero.

Duplicate the animation, rename it to "Crossfade_Start" and reverse the key points on the timeline so it fades to black.

Go to each animation and uncheck "Loop Time".


In the Animator make sure "Entry" is connected to "Crossfade_End".

Right click on "Crossfade_End" in the animator and "Make Transition" to "Crossfade_Start".

In Parameters click the "+" in the upper right corner and create a "Trigger" and name it "Start".


Now go to "File" > "Build Settings".

The scenes should be added in the top box in the order you want them to be. 

If they are not there then drag and drop them in the order you want them.


In "Level Loader" create the script component "LevelLoader".



LevelLoader script:

Above the "void Start()"-function write:
	public Animator transition;
    	public float transitionTime = 1f;

Remove the "void Start()"-function.

Inside the "void Update()"-function write:
	if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            LoadNextLevel();
        }

Under the "void Update()"-function write:
	public void LoadNextLevel() {}
	IEnumerator LoadLevel(int LevelIndex) {}

Inside the "public void LoadNextLevel()"-function write:
	StartCoroutine(LoadLevel(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex + 1));

Inside the "IEnumerator LoadLevel(int LevelIndex)"-function write:
	transition.SetTrigger("Start");
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(transitionTime);
        SceneManager.LoadScene(LevelIndex);

SAVE.

Make sure that the "Level Loader" object in Unity is in both the scenes you want to fade into and from.
