Description:

This tutorial describes a NavMesh movement where you click on a Ground object and have your Player object turn and head towards the point clicked on.

Assets:

Ground
Player

PlayerMotor script:

Create a script on the Player object.

Above "Public class PlayerMotor" write:
	[RequireComponent(typeof(NavMeshAgent))]

Above the "Start()"-function write:
	NavmeshAgent agent;

Inside the "Start()"-function write:
	agent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>();

Remove the "Update()"-function and replace it with "public void MoveToPoint(Vector3 point){}"

Within the "MoveToPoint(Vector3 point)"-function write:
	agent.SetDestination(point);

SAVE.


PlayerController script:

On the Player object add another script component called "PlayerController".

Above "public class PLayerController" write:
	[RequireComponent(typeof(PlayerMotor))]

above the "Start()"-function write:
	public LayerMask movementMask;
	Camera cam;
	PlayerMotor motor;

Inside the "Start()"-function write:
	cam = Camera.main;
	motor = GetComponent<PlayerMotor>;

Inside the "Update()"-function write as shown below:
	if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        {
            Ray ray = cam.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
            RaycastHit hit;

            if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, 100, movementMask))
            {
                motor.MoveToPoint(hit.point);
            }
        }

SAVE.

When you have both scripts you need to add a few more components.

Add component to Player:

	Capsule collider component and check the "Is Trigger" box.
	Add a Rigidbody component and check both the "Use Gravity" and "Is Kinematic" boxes.

Add compnent to Ground:

	You need to create a new layer in the "Layer" drop-down menu and click "Add Layer...", on the next available slot write "Ground".
	Go back to your Ground object and make sure it is on the "Ground" layer.
	Add a box collider component and do NOT check the "Is Trigger" box, the Ground object should not be a trigger.
	While on Ground, navigate the "Navigation" tab next to the "Inspector" tab. 
	In the "Navigation" tab, press the "Bake" button and then within "Advanced" press "Bake" that is next to "Clear".

Make sure to save.

When you have all the components and objects set up the Player should be able to move when you press play and you click anywhere on Ground.

**Optional**
Camera movement, follows the player movements.

On the Main Camera, add the script compnent "CameraController".

Remove the "Start()"-function.

Over the "Update()"-function write:
	public Transform target;
	public Vector3 offset;
	public float zoomSpeed = 4f;
    	public float minZoom = 5f;
    	public float maxZoom = 15f;
    	public float pitch = 1f;
    	private float currentZoom = 10f;

Inside the "Update()"-function write:
	currentZoom -= Input.GetAxis("Mouse ScrollWheel") * zoomSpeed;
	currentZoom = Mathf.Clamp(currentZoom, minZoom, maxZoom);

Under the "Update()"-function write:
	Private Void LateUpdate() {}

Inside of the "LateUpdate()"-function write:
	transform.position = target.position - offset * currentZoom;
	transform.LookAt(target.position + Vector3.up * pitch);

SAVE.
