For the final part of the tutorials, we will try to re-create the super mario 64 lava mechanics and port them over into 2D rather than being 3D. I thought it'd be a fun mechanic to experiment with.

First of all, we'd need to break down 2 key parts we need to make happen. We did both of them beforehand, we can make them again.

1 - It needs to remove [X] health.
2 - It needs to add Y velocity.

For the sake of cleanliness of code, I've done this in a second piece rather than in the health system. It's easy to do in the health system, but it's cleaner to develop if it doesn't have a ton ton ton of things inside of it,
plus here I can explain it a bit more in-depth for how simple the code is.

Let's get into it.

First of all, this code has no variables of it's own. Everything is being pulled from other bits of code. That's why we set some variables previously mentioned to Static.

That way, we don't need to redefine variables, PLUS, some code is there to influence other parts of the game.

You can remove void start and void update from this code.

Then, make a new void, call it OnCollisionEnter2D, just like in the health system script.

- If the collision object's tag is "lava", the player is launched upwards by 10, and 1 health drains.
- The way static variables work is that first you name the script it's being pulled from, add a dot and then make the edits. HealthSystem.Health is:
HealthSystem < --- Name of Script
health < --- Name of Variable

Anything past that is calculations we'd like to change.

We can also pick up a lot of different, smaller variables from the script.

- Controller2D.rB.velocity controls the velocity of the rigidbody. In order to keep it in line with the sideways speed, we need to only influence the Y axis.
To do that, we need to pull the current X rb velocity from the other script by making the rb velocity of the 2D Controller a new Vector2 where the first float of it is Controller2D.rB.velocity.x, which takes the current X velocity
and keeps it, the other being the height you want the player to be launched upwards.

    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D colObj)
    {
        if (colObj.gameObject.tag == ("lava"))
        {
            HealthSystem.health -= 1;
            Controller2D.rB.velocity = new Vector2(Controller2D.rB.velocity.x, 10);
        }
    }

That's it. This was more of a coding tutorial than a code tutorial, per se.

Complete code:

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class LavaBoost : MonoBehaviour
{

    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D colObj)
    {
        if (colObj.gameObject.tag == ("lava"))
        {
            HealthSystem.health -= 1;
            Controller2D.rB.velocity = new Vector2(Controller2D.rB.velocity.x, 10);
        }
    }
}
