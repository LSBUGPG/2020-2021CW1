I started off by copying old code I had in order to make tutorial 1.
First issue I ran into is that the code is complex, so it would require a lot of explanations regarding the code.
The way I can overcome this is by cross-referencing with the Unity Coding Guide.

I ran into no issues continuing with the smooth camera movement tutorial.

20/10/20

Camera Smoothing script is done.

Moving onto tutorial.

21/10/20

Tutorial for camera smoothing finished.

20/11/20

Worked through majority of 2D Controller. It was simplistic, so it had to go through multiple iterations. Hopefully won't need to re-make it.
Though, an issue with that is that it's simple, so will work through to make it more in-depth.

Plan is to have 2 big pieces of code and 2 smaller ones.

23/11/20

Found a really nice youtube video on how to improve 2D movement.
Decided to take inspiration from it & implement some of the fixes.

Due to that, I had to re-make the entire movement script.

Will keep prototyping with the new iteration to fit the fixes & improvements a bit better.

27/11/20

Managed to "fix" the 2D Controller script.

It works right now, although it needs a bit of polish & big bugfixes alongside numbers tweaking.

30/11/20

2D Controller fully functional.

Will move onto tutorial.

I want to explain static variables in order to grab one of the variables for further scripts.

Next 2 scripts will be simplier, as planned, for me to go a bit more in-depth about a few interesting things I think could be useful in the tutorials proper.

Work will slow down due to December starting.

2D Controller Tutorial done. Ran into some issues with how I wanted to explain certain things, but after a few re-writes, I set on a flow for it that's easy to follow.

Ontop of that, I've also run into a hole with not knowing what I want to do for the next 2 scripts. Will take a day or two of concepting of how to make them simpliest as possible.

Made the next 2 scripts today. I realized I can split a health system into 2 due to cleanliness in terms of in-engine development.

1 is a simple health system w/ debugger.
2 is a script that pulls static variables from both health and 2D controller to simulate lava mechanics from Super Mario 64 by Nintendo.

I had a lot of fun doing those two, although I've ran into a lot of issues in terms of the health system...

First iteration was too complex for what it was, and then I've kept simplifying and simplifying until it was as short as possible, but that runs into it's own issues:

How do I make the system work with nothing affecting it?

Decided to implement collisions into it, as well as this will pad out my tutorial so I can explain collisions & static variables.

13/12/20

Finished tutorial for Script 3.

17/12/20

Found some time to write up tutorial 4.

I found difficulty in explaining how static variables work.

Ended up realizing that I've put my expectations too low for who the tutorials would be for, and realized I can expect at least a tiny bit of coding prowess, so I used more in-depth ideas on how to explain it.
Happy with the result afterwards.

22/12/20

Cleaning up leftover tutorials & code before christmas hits.

30/12/20

Cleaning up Log & Journal.

Log will prove more difficult as I've been neglecting it, so some of the dates & times are missing. Listed my issues independently from the days worked, though.
Found it easier to fix when I don't need to list dates I've run into them.

Journal cleaned up for past entries, final date for journal updates planned on: 2nd Jan 2021.
