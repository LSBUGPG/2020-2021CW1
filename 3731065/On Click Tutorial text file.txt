Tutorial for Destroying gameobjects on click

Start by setting up your Unity scene. 
Add a few cubes to your scene and give them the tag "Box".
Create a new script "hit" and attach it to your camera. (You can also attach it to an empty gameobject as long as it is in the scene)

In void Update() create an if statement. As the input we will use our left mouse button, therefore we use the 0 as the indicator.


                            void Update()
                            {
                                   if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown (0)) 
                            
 
 In this script we will use Raycasting, it is used like a beam cast out from a point of origin that collides with objects inside the scene
 and returns that iformation in a "RaycastHit".

 In the next lines of our code we will set the main Camera as the point of origin for our Raycast.


                   var ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
                   RaycastHit hit;


 We will add another if statement defining the origin and direction of our Raycast. 
 Using the origin "ray" we just defined.



                  if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit)


 Now we can look for our gameobjects, in this case for gameobjects with the specific tag "Box". 
 We create another if statment to check if the gameobject hit in our raycast has that tag and then destroy it.


                  if(hit.collider.tag == "Box")
                              {                         
                    
                                      Destroy(hit.collider.gameObject); 
                              }


That is all that is needed. Here the whole code together:

 void Update()
    {
         if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown (0)) 
         {    
             var ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition); 
             RaycastHit hit;
 
             if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
             {
                 // whatever tag you are looking for on your game object
                 if(hit.collider.tag == "Box") 
                 {                         
                    
                     Destroy(hit.collider.gameObject);  
                 }    
             }
         }
    }
