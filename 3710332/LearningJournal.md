#Learning Journal

29/09/2020

Set up a github and repository to make the learning journal

Completed the tutoria; on how to spawn enemies into the level. This was quite simple which allowed me to get it done in not much time needed. 

4/10/2020

Completed the tutorial on enemy patrol system. Like the last tutorial it  didnt take me too long to complete

10/10/2020

Completed the tutorial on a character controller.

18/10/2020

Competed the tutorial objects following the mouse and turning the cursor invisible. This took me a bit longer but I did learn a decent amount from it. The time was mostly increased however because I was having untiy issues at the time.

Created an enemy script that makes the enemy follow the player using navmesh. This taught me quite a bit on 

10/11/2020

Created a script where the enemy stops within a certai range of the player. I thought this would be good as for games that use enemies like these, restricting thier movemnt would be best so the layer can dodge their attack(if an attack animation has been added in)

11/11/2020

Created a script so the enemy can be spawned by the press of a button. This is a temporary setting as in a game such as a zombie survival, the enemies would spawn automatically at timed intervals or when there is space in the level for them to spawn

The teleportation mchanic is the first thing i had attempted to do without following a tutorial. I did research before hand however on how to implement certain parts of it. In the end it was a success.

15/11/2020

I created a attach player script for my moving platforms. I had many issues with this however as the player would assume the scvale of the platforms and cause many issues gameplay wise. I did fix this later on in december however.

20/11/2020

Created a time slow mechanic to go with the teleporting. I thought that ading a time slow mechanic to my game would let players have an easier time using the teleporting and postioning themselves.

1/12/2020

Created a death and respawn script that takes the player back to the start of the level
